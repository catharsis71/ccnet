      <br />March 25 2005 - there's something about Cracky:
      <br />
      <br />&lt;d&gt; it's different though
      <br />&lt;d&gt; i'm not in love because i think she'd look nice naked, but because she has the nicest smile i've ever seen
      <br />&lt;d&gt; if it was about sex there are tons of better girls and women around
      <br />&lt;d&gt; but they are dead on the inside
      <br />&lt;d&gt; she looks so alive though
      <br />&lt;d&gt; there must be some medicine to help me, maybe i should search for that instead
      <br />&lt;d&gt; i am trembling, it would actually be horrible if it didn't feel so nice
      <br />&lt;d&gt; oh great now someone's posting that she's a boy
      <br />&lt;d&gt; i hate that text about murdering her
      <br />&lt;d&gt; it's still the sickest thing i've ever read even though i've read it a hundred times by now
      <br />&lt;d&gt; like i said, a mistake
      <br />&lt;d&gt; dude those 4chan people are seriously fucked in the head
      <br />&lt;d&gt; the way i see it is, if i had just stfu from the beginning about all of this then the situation would've probably turned out a lot better than it is now
      <br />
      <br />
      <br />April 7 2005 - a crisis of faith:
      <br />
      <br />&lt;d&gt; I think I'll quit all this internet shit too
      <br />&lt;d&gt; i don't care
      <br />&lt;d&gt; actually i care more than anything in the world
      <br />&lt;d&gt; it's the last thing i need now
      <br />&lt;d&gt; must forget
      <br />&lt;d&gt; must forget
      <br />&lt;d&gt; must forget
      <br />&lt;d&gt; THERE ARE
      <br />&lt;d&gt; OTHER THINGS IN MY LIFE
      <br />&lt;d&gt; than searching for a 14 year old girl
      <br />&lt;d&gt; you don't understand
      <br />&lt;d&gt; i wanted to know her NAME
      <br />&lt;d&gt; so in years past i could look her up and see what became of her
      <br />&lt;d&gt; IT HURTS
      <br />&lt;d&gt; IN A VERY EMO WAY
      <br />&lt;d&gt; humanity is a horrible blob of shit
      <br />
      <br />
      <br />April 16 2005 - discussing the origins of "so fucking cute and sweet":
      <br />
      <br />&lt;c&gt; That cartoon series seems to be made by an anti-fan.
      <br />&lt;d&gt; i know who wrote the text version
      <br />&lt;d&gt; not sure about the comic
      <br />&lt;c&gt; What text version?
      <br />&lt;d&gt; the She's so cute and sweet text
      <br />&lt;c&gt; Oh.&nbsp; I was talking about the "Cracky Chan Anon" comic series, not the "Guro".
      <br />&lt;d&gt; ah
      <br />&lt;d&gt; i'm not sure about that guy
      <br />&lt;c&gt; But who wrote "she's so fucking cute and sweet... they will be scarred for life"?
      <br />&lt;d&gt; &gt;&gt; Pfeizer 04/09/05(Sat)19:23 No.5522
      <br />&lt;d&gt;&nbsp; &gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a Cracky fanartist, I approve of this. Nice comic. I especially like how she died in the tub since I wrote a short story about her dying in a tub (with some assistance).
      <br />&lt;c&gt; He could be attempting to take credit for the work of another.
      <br />&lt;c&gt; It happened on Trolltalk all the time.
      <br />&lt;d&gt; not sure
      <br />&lt;d&gt; it would fit his personality
      <br />
      <br />
      <br />May 12 2005 - LJ discovery:
      <br />
      <br />&lt;d&gt; they found cracky-chan
      <br />&lt;d&gt; it's her
      <br />&lt;d&gt; same hello kitty wrist-watch for instance
      <br />&lt;d&gt; one of the pictures looks identical to the cracky-chan one
      <br />&lt;d&gt; in one of the comments she says she took the picture with the olympus camera
      <br />&lt;d&gt; she did delete some things
      <br />&lt;d&gt; some of the nude pictures
      <br />&lt;d&gt; http://www.livejournal.com/users/scarecrowmaiden/
      <br />&lt;d&gt; i sent her a mail telling her what she should delete
      <br />&lt;d&gt; she obviously doesn't want people to know
      <br />&lt;d&gt; i asked her in her lj if she's cracky and she said no, then deleted the whole thing an hour later
      <br />&lt;d&gt; she did after it was linked on 4chan
      <br />&lt;d&gt; i think her name's Lia or something
      <br />&lt;d&gt; i read it somewhere in lj but didn't have time to find it again
      <br />&lt;d&gt; Lia from Oxford
      <br />&lt;d&gt; compare
      <br />&lt;d&gt; you can even see the same pillar behind her
      <br />&lt;d&gt; i wish she'd reply to the email
      <br />&lt;c&gt; How are you feeling about all this?
      <br />&lt;d&gt; how should i feel?
      <br />&lt;d&gt; stressful, for one thing
      <br />&lt;d&gt; i don't know what to do
      <br />&lt;c&gt; Wait a minute... Europeonia is pretty small, right?&nbsp; Couldn't you just go drive to see her?&nbsp; There's water at some point but I think there's a tunnel.
      <br />&lt;d&gt; and then what?
      <br />&lt;c&gt; PEE IN HER BUTT
      <br />&lt;c&gt; Or just say hello.
      <br />&lt;d&gt; yeah actually a flight to london is like $50
      <br />&lt;c&gt; Go give her a hug.
      <br />&lt;c&gt; Were there nudes other than the "witch" pictures?&nbsp; I must've missed them.
      <br />&lt;d&gt; yes
      <br />&lt;c&gt; Share!
      <br />&lt;c&gt; Only evil capitalists don't share.
      <br />&lt;d&gt; yeah fine
      <br />&lt;c&gt; This is all kinda weird.
      <br />&lt;c&gt; Doesn't seem real.
      <br />&lt;c&gt; Like a bizarre dream.
      <br />&lt;c&gt; Only you're not sure if you're awake or asleep.
      <br />&lt;d&gt; never felt more awake in my life
      <br />&lt;d&gt; except the time i was in a car accident
      <br />&lt;c&gt; I haven't looked, but I would've guessed this would all already be all over 4chan.
      <br />&lt;d&gt; the admins are deleting the threads as they pop up
      <br />&lt;d&gt; i have to go
      <br />&lt;d&gt; OMG
      <br />&lt;d&gt; DID YOU FIND HER NAME?
      <br />&lt;d&gt; she deleted all the lj entries
      <br />&lt;d&gt; Deleted Account
      <br />&lt;d&gt; Deleted
      <br />&lt;d&gt; This journal has been deleted. If you are scarecrowmaiden, you have a period of 30 days from the deletion time to undelete the journal. After 30 days we will delete all content permanently from our servers.
      <br />&lt;d&gt; TELL ME YOU GOT HER NAME
      <br />&lt;d&gt; OMFG
      <br />&lt;d&gt; fuck
      <br />&lt;d&gt; nevermind, i found her name
      <br />&lt;d&gt; it's Lia
      <br />&lt;d&gt; maybe i could just tell her i like her and ask her for the new lj username
      <br />&lt;c&gt; That's one possibility.
      <br />&lt;d&gt; she didn't reply to the mail. perhaps i made it sound to apathetic
      <br />&lt;c&gt; YOU FAIL IT (it is tugging at the heart-strings of cracky-chan)
      <br />&lt;d&gt; yes
      <br />&lt;d&gt; why do so few people think she's pretty?
      <br />&lt;c&gt; Beauty is a function, not an attribute.
      <br />&lt;d&gt; there are some who are universally recognised as beautiful
      <br />&lt;c&gt; I doubt that.
      <br />&lt;d&gt; i can't think of any examples at the moment
      <br />&lt;d&gt; you know, you didn't really answer my question as to why so few people think she's beautiful
      <br />&lt;c&gt; Unless you've taken a proper survey you can't make that statement.
      <br />&lt;c&gt; Name any person and you will find at least a few people who aren't attracted to them.
      <br />&lt;d&gt; yes, but, what is wrong with cracky-chan that it appears that few people find her attractive?
      <br />&lt;d&gt; or equally, what is it about her that makes me think she's so incredibly beautiful?
      <br />&lt;c&gt; What about her many fans?&nbsp; How do you know the "bashers" aren't just one or two vocal people?
      <br />&lt;d&gt; just a guess
      <br />&lt;d&gt; but that seems unlikely from what i've seen
      <br />&lt;d&gt; oh and, many fans? like who?
      <br />&lt;d&gt; me and some other guy on lj
      <br />&lt;d&gt; and you, though you appear to be here just for the fun of it
      <br />&lt;c&gt; Just for the fun of it?&nbsp; What do you mean?
      <br />&lt;d&gt; i don't know
      <br />&lt;c&gt; Doesn't she have worshippers on 4chan?
      <br />&lt;c&gt; There's also at least one other person on Trolltalk.
      <br />&lt;c&gt; Isn't there a huge frenzy over her any time new information is revealed?
      <br />&lt;d&gt; 4chan threads about cracky-chan rapidly descent into "i'd hit it", "what an ugly whore", "what's this thread about?" and "bus for cracky"
      <br />&lt;d&gt; i should email her again
      <br />&lt;d&gt; but i don't know how to approach the issue
      <br />&lt;d&gt; i can't just go "sup plz give me ur new lj"
      <br />&lt;d&gt; and explaining my undying love for her would be less likely to work
      <br />&lt;d&gt; probably
      <br />&lt;d&gt; maybe she's not replying because she thinks i'm insane
      <br />&lt;d&gt; i asked her if she's cracky-chan and linked to the site, and she replied "unfortunately, no"
      <br />&lt;d&gt; then 30 minutes later she deleted it
      <br />&lt;d&gt; i hope she didn't do anything stupid
      <br />&lt;d&gt; i couldn't knowing that i had something to do with it
      <br />&lt;d&gt; live*
      <br />&lt;c&gt; You didn't have anything to do with it.&nbsp; You're probably one of the least repugnant of the hundreds of people who have surely contacted her in the past few days.

      <br />May 12 2005 - post LJ discovery, D attempts to e-mail Olivia:

      <br />&lt;d&gt; Mailer:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mutt/1.3.28i
      <br />&lt;d&gt; assuming you do not want to be known as cracky-chan then it would probably be a
      <br />&lt;d&gt; good idea to get rid of the following:
      <br />&lt;d&gt; http://www.livejournal.com/users/scarecrowmaiden/347462.html?thread=1808454#t1808454
      <br />&lt;d&gt; cameras put various data about the photos you take into the images files and
      <br />&lt;d&gt; the cracky-chan pictures just happen to have been taken by the same camera.
      <br />&lt;d&gt; the blood2.jpg picture looks almost identical to one of the cracky-chan pictures
      <br />&lt;d&gt; in the unoaX.jpg files you have the same wrist-watch as cracky-chan
      <br />&lt;d&gt; should I go on?
      <br />

      <br />&lt;d&gt; Mailer:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mutt/1.3.28i
      <br />&lt;d&gt; Is still email still working?
      <br />&lt;d&gt; I'm not sure how to phrase this and not sound either too apathetic
      <br />&lt;d&gt; or too pathetic, so I'll just say it plainly. I like you a lot.
      <br />&lt;d&gt; Ever since I saw your pictures on 4chan I thought you were
      <br />&lt;d&gt; incredibly beautiful. Unlike most people, you look like beauty
      <br />&lt;d&gt; comes naturally to you, without any effort and I think that
      <br />&lt;d&gt; that is just amazing. I've tried to forget about you at various
      <br />&lt;d&gt; points in the last few months, but it hasn't worked. Now that your
      <br />&lt;d&gt; livejournal account has been found I saw that you are also an
      <br />&lt;d&gt; interesting and fun person, so I'm asking you honestly if you would
      <br />&lt;d&gt; be kind enough to tell me if you are still on livejournal and what
      <br />&lt;d&gt; your account name is. I just want to be able to check that you are
      <br />&lt;d&gt; still alive and well and maybe see what you are up to occasionally,
      <br />&lt;d&gt; else I'll always wonder what became of you and if you're still OK.
      <br />&lt;d&gt; Please?
      <br />

      <br />May 14 2005 - discussion of Neil Gaiman and such:
      <br />
      <br />&lt;d&gt; neil gaiman signed on her wrist with a marker
      <br />&lt;c&gt; WOW.
      <br />&lt;d&gt; irc is like notepad, just ignore it if it's not relevant to your interests
      <br />&lt;c&gt; I know who Neil Gaiman is.&nbsp; I know plenty of people who are obsessed with him.
      <br />&lt;c&gt; Did I sound sarcastic?
      <br />&lt;d&gt; a bit
      <br />&lt;d&gt; "in fact i've had a particular obsession with bodymods etc lately..."
      <br />&lt;d&gt; omg no
      <br />&lt;d&gt; omg no
      <br />&lt;c&gt; No?
      <br />&lt;d&gt; i hope she doesn't do anything stupid
      <br />&lt;c&gt; What makes you think she might?
      <br />&lt;d&gt; like piercings
      <br />&lt;d&gt; the above comment
      <br />&lt;d&gt; and
      <br />&lt;d&gt; "love it! some of those pictures are gorgeous...i might post them. i've seen bmezine before but i missed all those pages, and had pretty much forgotten about it T_T so thank you!!"
      <br />&lt;d&gt; in reponse to a bmezine link/post
      <br />&lt;c&gt; Hm.
      <br />&lt;d&gt; she seems to be quite intelligent and worldly
      <br />&lt;c&gt; and so fucking cute and sweet
      <br />&lt;d&gt; i thought she was rather dumb when i glanced through her journal when it was still up
      <br />&lt;d&gt; but apparently she's read a lot of books and seen a lot of things

      <br />&lt;d&gt; hey, how do you feel about the cracky-chan.com site? does it bother you? i
      <br />&lt;d&gt; made it thinking someone else posted the pictures and that you would never
      <br />&lt;d&gt; know, but now... if you want i could remove it completely, or just remove
      <br />&lt;d&gt; the pictures or something
      <br />&lt;d&gt; plz advise. i don't want to do anything against your wishes
      <br />&lt;d&gt; p.s. could you reply when you get this even if you don't care? your
      <br />&lt;d&gt; disappearance is kind of worrying
      <br />&lt;d&gt; p.p.s. sorry that you had to delete your lj. it looked like it was

      <br />June 12 2005 - short and #sweet:
      <br />
      <br />&lt;d&gt; her name's olivia
      <br />
      <br />
      <br />July 24 2005 - D discusses his ongoing effort to contact Olivia via Marina (Deadjournal "amarie"):
      <br />
      <br />&lt;d&gt; actually your superior bullshitting ability might be useful right now
      <br />&lt;d&gt; you see, i've established contact with a good friend of olivia's
      <br />&lt;d&gt; where established contact = exchanged 10 words and gotten her to email me
      <br />&lt;d&gt; now i'm not sure what to do next
      <br />&lt;d&gt; help me out then
      <br />&lt;c&gt; Okay.
      <br />&lt;d&gt; her friend is a 21 year old not-too-bright brazilian girl
      <br />&lt;d&gt; if that helps
      <br />&lt;c&gt; Okay.
      <br />&lt;d&gt; right well basically i need to ask her about olivia in a way that doesn't make me sound like a complete idiot
      <br />&lt;c&gt; It can't happen soon.&nbsp; You'll have to build a relationship first.&nbsp; Establish trust.&nbsp; Make real conversation.
      <br />&lt;d&gt; oh uhm
      <br />&lt;d&gt; i guess it's kind of too late for that
      <br />&lt;c&gt; What happen ??
      <br />&lt;d&gt; i kind of said i had something to ask her
      <br />&lt;c&gt; Well, hmm.
      <br />&lt;c&gt; This is a bit of a puzzler...
      <br />&lt;c&gt; I'm conflicted.&nbsp; You could either ask her something else, and then work on establishing regular communiction.&nbsp; Or you could go ahead &amp; get it over with, although I'm going to have to ponder exactly how that could be done.
      <br />&lt;c&gt; Did you know Brazil speaks Portuguese, not Spanish?
      <br />&lt;d&gt; i was vaguely aware of the fact yes
      <br />&lt;c&gt; Pump It Up is really big in Brazil.&nbsp; I think last year's world championship was there.&nbsp; But anyway.
      <br />&lt;c&gt; What is the context of the interaction with her?&nbsp; You just e-mailed her to ask if you could ask her a question?
      <br />&lt;d&gt; no
      <br />&lt;d&gt; she didn't list her email address in her journal
      <br />&lt;d&gt; so i had to get an account first, which meant getting an invite code
      <br />&lt;d&gt; which was difficult because i don't know any goths
      <br />&lt;c&gt; This is not Livejournal, then.
      <br />&lt;c&gt; Xanga?&nbsp; Myspace?&nbsp; Deadjournal?
      <br />&lt;d&gt; one of those, yes
      <br />&lt;c&gt; Continue.
      <br />&lt;d&gt; so i commented in her journal that i wanted to talk to her
      <br />&lt;d&gt; and left my email
      <br />&lt;d&gt; and now she has emailed me
      <br />&lt;d&gt; --
      <br />&lt;c&gt; So how important is this to you?&nbsp; I think you'll have better chances if you establish communication &amp; turn her into an ongoing source which can be occassionally milked for information.&nbsp; Trying to do this by e-mailing one question would run a high risk of failure, even if you could think of a good way to pull it off. I'm not getting any good ideas offhand; I'd have to sleep on it.
      <br />&lt;c&gt; Do we presume that she knows about Lia's recent trials &amp; tribulations?
      <br />&lt;d&gt; yes
      <br />&lt;c&gt; What is the nature of their relationship?
      <br />&lt;d&gt; how am i supposed to know?
      <br />&lt;c&gt; I don't know what you know and what you don't since I know nothing of the circumstances involved.&nbsp; But you somehow seem to know what they're friends of some sort.
      <br />&lt;d&gt; i'd say they were good friends
      <br />&lt;c&gt; Internet only or meatspace?
      <br />&lt;d&gt; well she's in brazil.
      <br />&lt;d&gt; but they might've met sometime
      <br />&lt;c&gt; So you only know that they know each other, but aren't really clear on the details of how.
      <br />&lt;d&gt; i got the impression that they were really good friends
      <br />&lt;c&gt; Do you fantasize about them "exploring their sexuality" together?
      <br />&lt;d&gt; i hadn't until now
      <br />&lt;c&gt; You're welcome.
      <br />&lt;c&gt; But get your mind out of the gutter, son!&nbsp; You have a job to do.
      <br />&lt;d&gt; i'm just not good at all at first impressions
      <br />&lt;c&gt; Hmm.&nbsp; Let's start at a possible outcome and work backwards from there.&nbsp; Ideally, what would you like to find out from this girl?
      <br />&lt;d&gt; ideally she'd tell me how to contact olivia
      <br />&lt;c&gt; If you found one or more of Olivia's other journals already, what's stopping you from contacting her that way in the same way you contacted the other girl?
      <br />&lt;d&gt; friends only and not updated since nov. 2004
      <br />&lt;c&gt; Was she active in any of the Brazil girl's journal entries at any point?&nbsp; And have you checked these entries for any mention of her recent fate?
      <br />&lt;d&gt; the girl's journal is also friends only
      <br />&lt;d&gt; except for one entry
      <br />&lt;d&gt; and i've checked lots of journals, none of them mention anything
      <br />&lt;c&gt; Where are you getting this impression that they're good friends?
      <br />&lt;d&gt; the other journals
      <br />&lt;c&gt; Okay, here's a CRAZY idea.&nbsp; This is far out, but I want you to add it to your list of options and at least give it some consideration.
      <br />&lt;c&gt; What about -- no bullshit at all.&nbsp; Don't try to pull off a massive con.&nbsp; You can always try that later if you have to.&nbsp; Here's my crazy idea for what to do with THIS opportunity: just tell the truth, or at least as much of it as it would be beneficial to tell.
      <br />&lt;c&gt; Say that you're aware that her friend of Olivia had some trouble from Internet people on 4Chan and then went silent.&nbsp; Say that the sudden vanishment and nasty suicide rumors have made you really worry that she's okay.&nbsp; Don't let on that you have any vested interest, just basic concern for a fellow human being.&nbsp; Don't ask how to contact her, just ask if she's okay, and if the Brazil girl has even heard anything from her lately.
      <br />&lt;c&gt; You probably won't get very specific information, but you have a good chance of at least getting a broad overview:&nbsp; i.e. "she killed herself," or "she's okay but she's dropped off the internet completely," or "everything's fine, she just changed all her nicknames so she could make a fresh start."&nbsp; Something like that.&nbsp; People will generally tell you MORE than you ask them, if you ask them the right question.&nbsp; You'll at least be on the right track afterwards.
      <br />&lt;c&gt; And, of course, you didn't "track down" her journal, you just found it linked on one of the Cracky stalker sites, which absolutely *outraged* you at how they were attempting to harass this poor innocent girl &amp; her friends.
      <br />&lt;c&gt; Make sure you load the word "them" with a ton of contempt when referencing the stalkers.
      <br />&lt;d&gt; yes that was the general idea
      <br />&lt;d&gt; i have no idea how to put that in writing though
      <br />&lt;c&gt; Bah, if you're really stumped, I could probably whip something out on my plane ride on Monday, but you'd have to customize it since I don't know any of the details.&nbsp; It would just be a form letter.
      <br />&lt;d&gt; the problem is the actual wording
      <br />&lt;d&gt; i'm not a native speaker after all
      <br />&lt;d&gt; i learnt english from books. i don't know how they talk casually
      <br />&lt;c&gt; If you want me to write it, just say so, but you'll have to personalize &amp; customize it afterward and fill in the missing details or it'll sound way too vague.
      <br />&lt;d&gt; how should i start?
      <br />&lt;d&gt; "hi"? "hello"? "dear sir or madame"?
      <br />&lt;c&gt; It's hard for me to say, since I don't know her.&nbsp; The opening salutation probably doesn't matter much.&nbsp; And she might not be a native English speaker either.&nbsp; I already gave you a general outline for the letter.&nbsp; If you want me to write the actual letter you'll have to give me some sleep &amp; a couple of days.
      <br />&lt;d&gt; i should probably reply today. waiting won't do any good
      <br />&lt;c&gt; Well then, just don't second-guess yourself.&nbsp; Just say what you think, leaving off anything that she doesn't need to know.
      <br />&lt;c&gt; Well, as delightful as this has been, it's kept me up until 6AM when I intended to be in bed by midnight.&nbsp; So I should go.
      <br />&lt;d&gt; oh okay
      <br />&lt;d&gt; good night
      <br />&lt;c&gt; I appreciate you giving me a second chance.
      <br />&lt;c&gt; Good luck with your letter.
      <br />&lt;c&gt; You'll do great.
